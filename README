mysql-benchmark

This tool tries to address a niche in MySQL benchmarking: there are little to
no good parallel tools to benchmark MySQL databases that are efficient and at
the same time allow customization.

mysql-benchmark runs massively parallel benchmarks using exclusively your
queries. This grants you full control over your benchmark workload. The tool
also allows several types of automatic generation of values, including
pre-determined ranges, randomly generated values, and choosing values from a
list either in ordered or unordered semi-random fashion.

This tool uses processes and UDP message passing to synchronise benchmark
partial results. In the near future I plan to extend it to allow multiple
distributed benchmarks to be started and run from separated hosts and still
provide a consolidated report.
